# Skill Badges or Certified Skills

## What's a skill badge?

A skill badge is a way to certificate from BeCode that a specific skill has been acquired. We will try as much as possible to accompany each badge with a proof (URL of the code or functionality as the case may be).

Even before BeCode opened, we already wanted to "break the codes" (as our Spanish counterparts say so well). We therefore wish to make CVs and motivation letters obsolete. We would like to see recruitment focus more on skills (hard and soft) and less on politeness.

So, we are developing a system of competence badges. In the long run, this will make it possible:
- to reward a learner when he or she has acquired a skill ;
- formalize this skillâ€™s acquisition ;
- automatically complete evaluation reports during training ;
- recruiters (employers and clients) to recruit the profiles that interest them.
