## Internal regulations

For life to be pleasant for BeCode, some rules must be respected by everyone. It's about the collective management of your classroom and the building, the schedules, the respect of the material and how to deal with the outside.

Beyond the legal regulation, other rules must be applied for a harmonious common life.

### Collective management of the classroom

The classroom is managed by all of the individuals who occupy it. A person in charge of cleaning comes three times a week, she takes care of the overall cleanliness: dust, vacuum cleaner... It is in no way their job to throw trash in garbage cans, etc.

So :

- I wash my dishes day by day.
- I throw my trash in the proper bins.
- I make sure to throw away my out-of-date products stored in the refrigerator.
- I make sure to keep the toilets clean.

### Respect of schedules: what about delays and absences?

I respect training schedules.

- Training hours: Monday to Friday, from 9:00 to 17:00
- Morning break: 11h to 11h15
- Lunch break: from 12:30 to 13:30
- Afternoon break: 15:00 to 15:15

One of the objectives of the training is to professionalize the learners. In other words, learners will have to behave as if they are integrating a business. So :

- Any planned absence must be announced via the interface [my.becode.org](https://my.becode.org/) **at least one day before**.
- Any absence or delay (or early departure) must be:
	1. announced via the interface [my.becode.org](https://my.becode.org/) ([manual of utilization](https://github.com/becodeorg/BeCode/blob/master/procedure-mybecode.md))
	1. justify with **a medical certificate or administrative proof** sent via my.becode.org then the document will be hand-delivered to the coaches.

#### Sanctions

If this is not the case, the following sanctions will be implemented:

- 2 unjustified delays (or early departure) will be counted as absence;
- 2 absences will lead to an individual interview;
- 6 unjustified absences will result in permanent exclusion;
- If the absence rate (justified or not) exceeds 20%, BeCode may decide on the final exclusion of the learner.

Reminder: **Predate and / or falsely certify a disease are criminal offenses punishable by law**.

### Respect for the material

- I pay attention to the material that was lent to me.
- If a malfunction occurs, I inform the team.
- I undertake to return the borrowed material in the state where I received it.

### How to deal with the outside

BeCode is located in a collective space where businesses reside. It is necessary to respect them:

- I throw my cigarette butts in the jars or the located near the front door
- I do not throw anything but my butts into these pots.

### Sustainability - posterity


In order for BeCode to fulfill its reporting commitments as a social and solidarity-based company, BeCoders undertake to respond to follow-up surveys at the start of training, three months, six months, twelve months. and twenty-four months after the end of the training.

Also, they undertake to show goodwill in their response to solicitations of testimony that they may be subject to. It's also important to be aware of everyone's role in BeCode's reputation. The behavior of each one must always be professional.

### Work atmosphere: collaboration and respect

Learners are committed to participate in training-related activities that will increase their skills that are essential to enter the job market.

In close proximity to groups working in silence and concentration, everyone must be careful to maintain the quietest and the calmest work environment possible.

BeCoders are expected to be respectful and tolerant of each other in their words as well as in their attitudes.

Reminder: **Discriminatory language is prohibited and punishable by law**.

### Access and use of computers

Computers are strictly personal. In order to comply with the BeCode pedagogy, the only person authorized to use your computer is the learner himself/herself. Trainers are not allowed to touch another computer than theirs (at least not without permission). Other learners also do not have the right to touch someone else's computer. Thereby, each learner has to code by himself/herself, to seek a solution and to solve a problem by him/herself. Of course, it is strictly forbidden to go to the computers of the members of the teaching team.

Always concerning computers, they are loaned to you free of charge and are under your responsibility. Learners are expected to use computers exclusively for work.

### Basic rules for using Ryver

Ryver is BeCode's daily communication platform. You are asked to put in display name your first name and your last name. In profile photo, you are asked to put a photo of you recognizable and recent. It is a professional communication platform, so you are asked to behave professionally. Any abuse will be punished.
