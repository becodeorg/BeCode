# my.becode.org : badges

The skill badges issued by BeCode can be obtained in several ways.

## What is it, what is it for?

First of all, know that they certify that an organization recognized by Bruxelles Formation, le FOREM and VDAB (BeCode in your case) certifies that you have technical or other skills.    

You can [share your competence badges on your LinkedIn profile](certified-skills-eng.md) and also on your personal sites (portfolio).    

We also use them for the Talents platform (to come) which will allow BeCode Juniors to connect with employers.    
These badges will also appear on the evaluation reports that show that you have acquired different skills during your journey.    

We are currently working closely with the various national and international actors to have our system recognized and also to encourage other training centres to use it. We also have been raising awareness among employers since the opening of BeCode so that they are aware of the value of these badges.


## For technical skills

You worked on a project that presented pedagogical challenges to be validated or acquired. You have successfully completed the project and demonstrated that you are able to use the required skills.
- Your coach spontaneously assigns you the skill badges as and when he realizes that you deserve this or that badge.
- You request your competence badges via my.becode.org by following the procedure:


### Procedure
The platform asks you to fill
- ``URL from GitHub Repository`` => where the code can be inspected,
- ``URL from the project Site`` => where you can test the code / see the functional site.

If you do not provide the right URLs, we will not search for you. We will therefore refuse to issue the badge and you will be invited to re-claim it.

## For non-technical badges
(soft-skills, participation in events,...) :
- you can request your competence badge via my.becode.org. The platform asks you to enter an ``URL from GitHub Repository`` (where you can inspect the code) and an ``URL from the project Site`` (where you can test the code/see the functional site). Since these are not technical skills, simply indicate in both fields the URL of your GitHub account.
